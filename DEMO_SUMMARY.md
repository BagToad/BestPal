# GamerPal SQLite Integration - Quick Demo

## What's Been Added

I've successfully integrated SQLite database functionality into your GamerPal Discord bot with two new commands:

### 🗃️ `/data store`
Store key-value pairs in the database:
```
/data store key:favorite_game value:Cyberpunk 2077
/data store key:platform value:PC
/data store key:hours_played value:150
```

### 📊 `/data fetch`
Retrieve your stored data:
```
/data fetch key:favorite_game    # Get specific data
/data fetch                      # Get all your data + database stats
```

## Key Features

✅ **User-Isolated Storage**: Each Discord user gets their own data space  
✅ **Persistent Database**: Data survives bot restarts  
✅ **UPSERT Operations**: Updates existing data or creates new entries  
✅ **Timestamps**: Tracks when data was created and last updated  
✅ **Beautiful Embeds**: Rich Discord embeds with emojis and formatting  
✅ **Database Statistics**: Shows total records, unique users, last activity  
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of database issues  
✅ **Ephemeral Responses**: All responses are private to the user  

## Technical Implementation

- **Database**: SQLite with optimized schema and indexes
- **File**: `gamerpal.db` created automatically in the bot directory
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into existing command structure
- **Cleanup**: Proper database connection closure on bot shutdown
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite demonstrating all functionality

## Files Modified/Created

1. **`internal/commands/handler.go`** - Added database to Handler struct and new command registration
2. **`internal/commands/data.go`** - Complete implementation of data commands
3. **`internal/bot/bot.go`** - Added database cleanup on shutdown
4. **`test_sqlite.go`** - Comprehensive test demonstrating all functionality
5. **`SQLITE_POC.md`** - Complete documentation

## Testing

The proof of concept has been thoroughly tested:

```bash
# Test the SQLite functionality
go run test_sqlite.go

# Build the bot with new features
go build ./cmd/gamerpal

# All existing tests still pass
go test ./...
```

## Ready to Use

The bot is now ready to be deployed with SQLite functionality. Users can start using `/data store` and `/data fetch` commands immediately to store and retrieve persistent data.

The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling, user isolation, and database management.
